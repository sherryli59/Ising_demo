If you have a plan for a new repo but haven't done anything yet, it's likely easier to start from the github website and clone into an empty repo that you set up there. We'll start with the command line repo from an existing repository. In this case you can begin by initializing git and adding everything locally. \n"

    "\n",
    "Unit testing is a broad topic, but there are two main packages that can be used for unit testing in python. There is unittest, which is the built-in python unit testing suite and pytest, which is a separate packaged. Both work fine, pytest is generally a bit easier to use and is what we will be describing here. \n",

    "Generally there are a few ways to design unit tests. Emmit's preferred approach, which is probably not the best is to have two kinds of unit tests - some smaller ones that check core functionality, and one large one that guarantees that the entire program continues to produce the same results after you've made changes. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the latter, generally the best bet is to seed the random number generator,  instatiate either the entire system to run some dynamics or to run the entire process on random data and store the output. From here you can then run the exact same process in the testing suite with the same seed. By simply storing the output this means that you can guarantee that any changes you make the underlying code base do not change the behavior that you actually care about (usually trajectory information). If you make changes that are expected to change the codes's functionality, then you will want to rerun the data generating file since you would expect the trajectory to change. You may have more than one of these if you have different simulation conditions, or you may just have one for the most complicated simulations you are likely to encounter. \n",
    "\n",
    "Smaller unittests are generally most useful when you have some sort of mathematical or physical guarantee that should hold true. If you have a conserved property, then you may want a unit test that will guarantee that property is actually being conserved as you make development decisions to implement new features. \n",
    "\n",
    "For most scientific code, I don't find unit testing to assert that things are object types or intermediate range testing to be useful. You mostly just need to know if your changes are actually changing code behavior for different simulations types. Testing the things that you need to know and knowing if your changes change observable behavior is generally sufficient for most purposes and avoids having to write lots of tests. "
